# Top 10 List of Week 09

### 1. [MBR and GPT](https://www.tembolok.id/panduan-gpt-vs-mbr/)
The differences between an MBR and GPT partition are pretty straightforward. But there's a lot of background information that will help you get a clearer picture about each type of partition table, and when you should choose one over the other. In contrast, GPT partition tables offer a maximum capacity of 9.7 zetabytes. 1 zetabyte is about 1 billion terabytes, so you're unlikely to run out of space anytime soon.

### 2. [HDD vs SSHD vs SSD](https://platinumdatarecovery.com/blog/ssd-vs-sshd-compared)
While the choice depends mostly on preferences, laptops have rooms only for a single drive thus making it a trickier decision. You can choose hard drives if you want to store more data inexpensively. The SSHD learns which applications are most used and to accommodate faster loading times and better performance, those are stored in the Solid-state storage.

### 3. [Difference Between UEFI and BIOS](https://www.maketecheasier.com/differences-between-uefi-and-bios/)
BIOS and UEFI are two firmware interfaces for computers which work as an interpreter between the operating system and the computer firmware. Both of these interfaces are used at the startup of the computer to initialize the hardware components and start the operating system which is stored on the hard drive. UEFI is meant to completely replace BIOS and bring in many new features and enhancements that can’t be implemented through BIOS.

### 4. [What is Non Volatile Memory](https://techterms.com/definition/non-volatile_memory)
Since most storage devices need to maintain data without power, non-volatile memory is far more common than volatile memory. In computers, volatile memory is primary used for RAM and temporary cache storage. NVM is a type of memory that retains stored data after the power is turned off.

### 5. [Dual Booting](https://www.howtogeek.com/187789/dual-booting-explained-how-you-can-have-multiple-operating-systems-on-your-computer/)
Even if you only have a single hard drive, you can have multiple operating systems on that hard drive by partitioning the drive into several different partitions. When you install a Linux distribution, it typically installs the Grub boot loader. Grub loads instead of the Windows boot loader at boot time if Windows was already installed, allowing you to choose the operating system you want to boot.

### 6. [Cloud Storage Environment Impact](https://spinbackup.com/blog/cloud-storage-environmental-impact/#:~:text=The%20main%20environmental%20impact%20of,maintain%20very%20large%20data%20centers.&text=Additionally%2C%20the%20servers%20require%20cooling,has%20a%20massive%20energy%20requirement.)
The main environmental impact of using the cloud comes from the amount of energy it takes to run and maintain very large data centers. As these data centers contain thousands of servers, all of which must be powered on 24/7 to ensure their clients have access to their data at all times, the energy needs of each data center is substantial. Additionally, the servers require cooling systems to combat the constant heat they are generating, which also has a massive energy requirement.

### 7. [Disk Scheduling](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-disk-scheduling)
As we know, a process needs two type of time, CPU time and IO time. For I/O, it requests the Operating system to access the disk. However, the operating system must be fare enough to satisfy each request and at the same time, operating system must maintain the efficiency and speed of process execution. The technique that operating system uses to determine the request which is to be satisfied next is called disk scheduling.

### 8. [Opencore and GRUB Comparation](https://www.saashub.com/compare-opencore-vs-grub)
Opencore is an open source to select booting file in choosing os. Unlike Grub that owned by linux, Opencore mainly used to hackintosh because its open source for community. Grub is winning many aspect from Opencore, such as IT Automation, Cloud Computing, and Developer Tools.

### 9. [3 Sign Your Hard Drive is Falling](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-signs-hard-drive-lifetime/)
Slowing Computer, Frequent Freezes, Blue Screen Of Death. This trifecta of a PC breakdown can have a million different causes, and a failing hard drive is one of them. If these problems occur after a fresh installation or in Windows Safe Mode, the root of the evil is almost certainly bad hardware, possibly a failing hard drive. 

### 10. [Deleted Files: Where Do They Go?](https://www.harddriverecovery.org/blog/deleted-files/#:~:text=Sure%2C%20your%20deleted%20files%20go,one%20that's%20labeled%20recycle%20bin.)
No one knows where broken hearts go. But do you know where deleted files go? Sure, your deleted files go to the recycle bin. Once you right click on a file and choose delete, it ends up there. However, that doesn’t mean the file is deleted because it’s not. It’s simply in a different folder location, one that’s labeled recycle bin.
